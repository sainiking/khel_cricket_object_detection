# Advanced Cricket Detection Project - Complete Execution Guide

## **Step-by-Step Execution Sequence**

This guide shows you **exactly** how to run each file in the correct order to set up, train, and use your **advanced cricket detection system** with dual-model architecture, enhanced ball detection, class weightage control, and visual customization.

---

## **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have:
- Python 3.8+ installed
- A cricket video file (`.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, or `.mkv`)
- Internet connection (for downloading YOLO weights)
- GPU recommended but not required
- Cricket dataset for training (13 classes: ball + 12 cricket objects)
- Understanding of class priorities for weightage configuration

---

## **Complete Workflow - Run These Commands in Order**

### **Step 1: Activate Environment** 
```bash
# Activate the cricket detection environment
source activate_cricket_env.sh
```
**What this does:**
- Activates the `cricket_env/` virtual environment
- Ensures all Python packages are available
- Shows confirmation message when ready

**Expected Output:**
```
 Advanced Cricket Detection Environment Activated!
 Available commands:
   python3 check_setup.py            - Check project setup
   python3 check_separate_models.py  - Check dual model capabilities
   python3 train_separate_models.py  - Train specialized models
   python3 simple_cricket_detector.py - Run advanced detection

   ‚Ä¢ Anti-overlap label positioning
```

---

### **Step 2: Verify Project Setup**
```bash
# Check that everything is properly configured
python3 check_setup.py
```
**What this does:**
- Verifies all required Python files exist
- Checks for dataset (roboflow_dataset/) if available

---

### **Step 3A: Extract Frames (If You Need Training Data)**
*Skip this if you already have the `roboflow_dataset/` folder*

```bash
# Extract frames from cricket video for annotation
python3 headless_frame_extractor.py
```
**What this does:**
- Finds cricket videos in current directory OR lets you specify a video
- Extracts frames at regular intervals (every 30 frames by default)
- Saves frames as numbered images with timestamps
- Creates output folder with extracted frames

**Interactive Process:**
```
 Cricket Frame Extractor
 Available videos:
   1. cricket_match.mp4
   2. batting_practice.avi

Select video (1-2): 1
 Extracting frames every 30 frames, max 100 frames
 Extracted 85 frames to extracted_frames_cricket_match/
```

**After this step:**
1. Upload extracted frames to [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com)
2. Manually annotate **13 classes**: Ball + 12 cricket objects (Bails, Batter, Batting Pads, Boundary Line, Bowler, Fielder, Helmet, Non-Striker, Stumps, Stumps Mic, Umpire, Wicket Keeper)
3. Download annotated dataset as `roboflow_dataset.zip`
4. Extract the zip file in your project directory
5. **Ball annotation is critical** for enhanced ball detection system

---

### **Step 3B: Check Model Status (Optional)**
```bash
# Check what models you have and their capabilities
python3 check_separate_models.py
```
**What this does:**
- Checks for existing trained cricket objects model
- Checks for ball detection model (custom or general)
- Shows what objects each model can detect
- Provides next steps based on your model availability

**Expected Output (if both models exist):**
```

## **Advanced Configuration Guide**

### **Class Weightage Recommendations:**
- **High Priority (2.0x - 3.0x)**: Ball, Batter, Wicket Keeper
- **Medium Priority (1.2x - 1.8x)**: Bowler, Fielder, Stumps
- **Low Priority (0.5x - 0.8x)**: Batting Pads, Stumps Mic, Boundary Line

### **Confidence Threshold Recommendations:**
- **Sensitive (0.2 - 0.4)**: Ball, Batter, Key players
- **Standard (0.4 - 0.5)**: Fielder, Bowler, Equipment
- **Less Sensitive (0.6 - 0.8)**: Background objects, Less critical items

### **Visual Customization Tips:**
- **Ball**: Bright green for high visibility
- **Players**: Distinct colors (orange, blue, purple)
- **Equipment**: Neutral colors (gray, brown)
- **Font Scale**: 0.5-0.8 for readability without clutter
- **Anti-overlap**: Always enable for clean display
